  |   The year is 50 B.C. Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans. Well,    |
  |   not entirely... One small village of indomitable Gauls still holds    |
  |   out against the invaders. And life is not easy for the Roman          |
  |   legionaries who garrison the fortified camps of Totorum, Aquarium,    |
  |   Laudanum and Compendium.                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Peace reigns in the small Armorican village, where the villagers go   |
  |   about their daily business. Our two heroes, Asterix and Obelix,       |
  |   hunt wild boar, the blacksmith and the fishmonger quarrel, and the    |
  |   village chief strolls around the village square atop his shield.      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   One day, the village druid, Getafix, receives a strange letter. It    |
  |   is from Hella Finidrir, the high priestess of Thule! She warns the    |
  |   druid of a grave threat to his people and asks him to take a          |
  |   mysterious Menhir out of its hiding place...                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Set off on an exciting adventure and immerse yourself in the world    |
  |   of Asterix! Alone or in co-op, explore the lands of the Roman         |
  |   empire and unravel the mystery of the Crystal Menhir and its          |
